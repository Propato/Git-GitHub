# Notes and Information

Here are some notes and information about Git, GitHub, or related topics that I developed and recorded in my studies. I am leaving them here for easy reference in case I need to review something, and I am making them available in case they can help other people, if anyone happens to see this.

Over time, I will add more information and correct/supplement any information if necessary.

I will also be correcting/updating the notes on Markdown and this README.
